# Parkinsons_SpeechRecog-
An attempt to try and detect Parkinson's disease using speech analysis

Our end objective is to try and detect Parkinson's disease using the voice of a patient.

We did not have the luxury of plenty of data available data so supervised learning was the best approach, park_data.py contains various algorithms and their accuracy using a *75-25* split.

Update:
-KNN produced the best accuracy of about 98% /n
-with XGB Boost coming in second w/ about 96% accuracy./n

Future steps are to determine what features actually contribute to the model and continue to fine-tune the models. Also getting more data would help better determine the accuracy of the models.
